        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate traveler / musician. It has always been my dream to travel the world. However I had an obsctacle to overcome - money!. 
          I wondered if it were possible to make money despite constantly changing city and often country. I tried many
          things, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Stocks</li>
          <li>Poker</li>
          <li>Marketing</li>
          <li>Accounting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After many failures and minor successes I discovered web development. I was immediately hooked and am now aspiring to one day run my
          own web development business from my laptop. This way I can still travel,  while also making money by doing something I
          am passionate about.</p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My primary goal is to one day run my own web development business from my laptop. However I also have a number of small goals that I will
          need to achieve in order to make this possible. Below are the topics / languages I hope to have an advanced knowledge in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I plan on completing all of the Treehouse's tech-degrees before moving on to personal projects. Once I feel as though I am
          competent in the web development space - I will begin applying for jobs & contracts in my area. I have no doubt I will be ready by 2021.</p>
